# Graph Theory

is the mathematical theory of the properties and applications of graphs(networks).

## Types of Graphs

## Undirected Graph

graph in which edges have no orientation

### Directed Graphs

graph in which edges have orientations

### Weighted Graphs

graphs where the edges contain a certain value

## Special Graph

### Tree

an undirected graph with no cycle, a connected graph with N nodes and N-1 edges

### Rooted Trees

a tree with a designated root node where every edge either points away from or towards the root node. When edges point away from the root graph it is called an **arborescence (out-tree)** and **anti-arborescence (in-tree)** for its counterpart.

### Directed Acyclic Graphs
