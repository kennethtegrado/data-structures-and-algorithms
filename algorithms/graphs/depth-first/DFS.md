# Depth First Search

The most fundamental search algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It runs with a time complexity of `O(V+E)` and is often used as a building block in other algorithms.

> By itself, it isn't that useful, when augments to perform other tasks such as count connected components, determine connectivity, or find bridges/articulation points then **DFS REALLY SHINES**
