## Analyzing Algorithms

**Analyzing** an algorithm has come to mean predicting the resources that the algorithm requires. Occasionally, resources such as memory, communication bandwith, or computer hardware are of primary concern, but most often it is computational time that we want to measure.


## Designing Algorithms
There are a variety of ways to develop an algorithm. These ways follow a technique known that are called as **algorithm design techniques**.

### Incremental Technique

### The Divide and Conquer Approach
Many useful algorithms are recursive in structure. In order to solve problems, some algorithms call themselves recursively one or more times to deal with closely related sub-problems. This technique is known as **divide and conquer**, algorithm break the problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size, solve the problems recursively, and then combine these solutions to create a solution to the original problem.

**Steps**
1. **Divide** the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straighforward manner.
3. **Combine** the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.

**Example:**
## Merge Sort
Is an algorithm that follows the principle of divide and conquer.
