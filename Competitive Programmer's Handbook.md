# Topics of Competitive Programing
## Design of Algorithms
Consists of problem solving and mathematical thinking. Skills for analyzing problems and solving them creative are needed. An algorithm for solving a problem has to be both correct and efficient, and the core of the problem is often about inventing an efficient algorithm.

Theoretical knowledge of algorithms is important to competitive programmers. Typically, a solution to a problem is a combination of well-known techniques and new insights. The techniques that appear in competitive programming also form the basis for the scientific research of algorithms.

## Implementation of Algorithms
This topic requires good programming skills. In CP, the solutions are graded by testing an implemented algorithm using a set of test cases.

**Contestants can use any programming language of their choice**. Despite this, many people use c++ for their codes because it is efficient and fast.
